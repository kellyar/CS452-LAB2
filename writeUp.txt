In this lab we used two different shaders.  The first shader is a vertex shader.  This shader is used to change the position of a vertex.  The second shader is a fragment shader which is used to determine the color a pixel.

In order to use these shaders the following actions must be done.

1. Create and compile both the vertex and fragment shader and get their ID's.
	- you use glCreateShader to create the shader and get the ID
	- use glShaderSoure to bind the source code to the shader (needs to happend before 
	  compilation)
	- Comile the shader using glCompileShader

2. Check for compilation errors.


3. Link the two shaders to a "program" and get the program ID.
	- You create the program using glCreateProgram() and get the ID
	- Then to attach the shaders to the progam use glAttachShader
	- Then call glLinkProgram to actually make the shader program
	- Lastly call glUseProgram to use the shader when you draw

Completing these steps allow you to make a shader program.
